some *very* rough, but adaptable, scripts and stylesheets to customize the WaterlooWorks job board.

## contents

script:
- counts the number of rejected/cancelled applications on the [applications page](https://waterlooworks.uwaterloo.ca/myAccount/co-op/full/applications.htm)
- disables the auto-logout timer
- redirects 'not logged in' status page to login page

stylesheet:
- grey-highlights shortlisted entries (ugly but improves skimming)
- hides table columns (hardcoded to my liking)

## set up

I personally use the following, but any extensions that load user css styles/userscripts will work.
- Styles - [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
- Script - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Likely not compatible with the WaterlooWorks Azure extension.
